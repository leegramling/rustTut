create a todo.md file with always, high, medium, low and done priorities. Think hard and create a 
  plan for a rust tutorial, with a top of developing a non graphics simulation engine for a stratagy
   game where space ships travel between astroids, planets and docking station and take raw mining 
  materials, ice, water, rare minerals and supplies, crews, parts and other resources back and 
  forth. The simulator will help manage resouces and the simulation of the ships. Think hard about 
  the simulator, how we might build a high performance simulation based on some type of behavior 
  graph. it will need to send data in a compressed delta format per frame to a cpp20 vulkan scene 
  graph using some messaging protocol, it might be zeroq, protobufs, or some other udp type 
  communication. The tutorial will help me learn how to program rust with a series of tutorial.md 
  files which give a lesson followed by code describing the lesson, then there will be a .rs file 
  with prompts of what to write and a tut##_complete.rs showing the answer. Here are the things I 
  want to learn. rust design patterns, generics, traits, functional programming, concurrency, 
  message passing, data-oriented programming/design, test driven development, refactoring, macro 
  writting, designing plugins, ffi for python interop, yaml, json or xml. Create a plan and add to 
  the todo.md. Add to always to git add and commit after each task.
